Net Utils
=======
NetUtils - is an Android library created to lighten developing of network applications. For instance, it allows you to render (map) data from a server directly to your layout. It also allows you to unmap ui to some object (to send to a server) and to map even complex structures with lists and sub-structures inside. Also, it has some interesting conceptions like auto-paginated list. You just give an interface that will return data from server and list will automatically inflate all layouts, add them to ListView and map data to that layouts and, when it's needed.

More of common information you can find [on this page](net-utils-brief-description.markdown).
